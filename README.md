# Kishan : Crop Insurance claims By (PMFBY) 

# Details

The Government of Odisha has * enrolled multiple farmers across the state under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) this year. The number of enrollments has been increasing every year and the Government hopes to reach more farmers in a short time.

Even though the scheme has been designed to be pro-farmer, there have been operational issues in the field. One such challenging problem is the delayed settlement of insurance claims and their rejection by insurance companies. Insurance companies are yet to clear almost 33 percent of estimated claims to the framers who come under the PMFBY. Due to these issues the state has witnessed farmer agitations about the lack of clarity in the settlement and disbursement of insurance claims.

# Solution
Building Enhanced Krishi Application for Claim of Insurance ( EKACI) ( where farmers can register, claim and track claim as well as government authorities can monitor, regulate and report actions taken), that is efficient enough to deal with the farmer insurance claims. We intend to adopt a decentralised blockchain approach to fix the glitch caused by insurance companies while settling claims, making each claim get settled at 2x faster rate.

Ekaciâ€™s Machine Learning model will reduce the troubles arising on the field while predicting the crop damage. Ekaci will give the farmers the liberty to upload and report the loss and provide prediction , if he/she is eligible for receiving insurance sum with the help of sensors.
